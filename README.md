# GameIT
The worlds 1st self-paced digital career ladder | PLAY GAMES | CLIMB THE LADDER | GET a career in Digital



ABOUT
The UK Digital economy was worth £149bn in 2018 and the estimate cost of the inherent SKILLS SHORTAGE was VALUED at £6.3bn in 2019.

The UK Currently has:
1.6m people unemployed (ONS)
1.9m households without internet access (Guardian)
Talks of a 'lost generation'
A prison system that offers offenders no second chance or route to a meaningful career
1 in 6 school aged children has a mental health condition (NHS Digital 2020)

Do you want social mobility to decline in the post-brexit UK?

This idea currently with the title "Game IT" is a way for us to invest in those who are currently excluded from the Digital industry.




PURPOSE
Boost the UK economy with diverse social capital

OUTCOMES
To facilitate a socially bound movement of people new to the digital industry who are learning the skills that will make them money now, and who are learning professions that will allow them to create their own destinies. 

STRATEGY
Communities & Parnerships!
Its that simple really... 
In order for this idea to have the impact we seek we need lots of people to all pull in the same direction, for a sustained period of time, and with regular moments of success - often characterised by lots of learning!
So we decided to throw the idea out there, and see what organically from the cosmic forces that bind us all together

Communities of passionate experts are needed
Communities of hopeful newbies are needed
Partnerships with SME's and FTSE100 employers are needed
Partnerships with UK Government Services are needed (particularly JobCentre & HM prison services)

!! EXPERTS NEEDED - Front End, Back end, Graphics, Designers, Marketers, Advertisers, Sales




LETS TALK SYSTEMS
If we take a birdseye view, you know, the "10,000 foot helicopter view" then you will see that this relatively big idea has 7 components that need to be glued together in a customer journey:

1. Skill games / aptitude tests to prove mental dexterity (like the remote tests for top grad schemes)
2. Digital role specific hands on, step by step, learning journey
3. Real industry scenario based Projects
4. Community groups, support, talks, webinars, training, coaching, mentoring opportunities etc.
5. Opportunity to engage in direct recruitment drives of all sized firms.
6. A philosophy of engineered mindfulness to prevent subscribers from spending excess periods of time looking at a screen without soulful replenishment
7. The Foundation Household Laptop & Wifi scheme (allowing people to add more on their monthly subscription to cover a % of another household without access. We then taking action to give 1.9m households (currenly excluded) access to regular wifi and at least 1 laptop)




THE FINANCIAL MODEL
So this bit is nice and simple. We charge for:
1. Company sponsoring a project / skill game
2. Company accessing back end of platform for "inclusion optimised" access to talent pool
3. Subscribers pay monthly (idealistic outlook on this is £6... we have been told to think more like £99.... but we want to hold onto inclusion for now!)
4. Organisation referral scheme for subscriber (If charg £6, they get £2 for every person)
5. Organisation waiver scheme - they tell us they will waive their referral fee, and we will also waive our profit margin goodbye, therefore making it hopefully around £2 per month at the lowest entry


HOW ARE WE GOING TO BUILD THIS THING?
The first thing we need is a clickable UI that allows us to demo this concept
In order to do so we need to also design some games, and in order to do that we need to know what role to focus on.
VERY SOON you will see the Product Backlog emerge :D
